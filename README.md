Summary of the Kaggle RL course


This repo contains my colab notebooks from the Kaggle RL courses. 

The key take away from this course has taught me: 

1) fundemantals of RL such as agent and its environment throught connect-4 by developing a basic agent 

2) improving the basic agent by implementing a heuristic approach by considering what the opponent might do next

3) improve this heuristic approach by looking into the next n-step

4) using deep RL, i.e, using policy optimization to solve connect-4
